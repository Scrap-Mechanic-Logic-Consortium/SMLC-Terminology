## Defining Terms
We are very specific about how each page is laid out. This is to keep the site consistent. Each term should be defined as follows:
1. the term being defined should be **bolded** in its first mention in the file by using `**double-asterisks**`.
2. include some example uses of the term
3. if the term is a real-world term, the definition must begin with a üéØ which can be inserted with `:dart:`
4. if the term is a real-world term, but with an adapted definition to word better in scrap mechanic, ‚ùó which can be inserted with `:exclamation:`
5. if the term is a made-up term for the purposes of scrap mechanic, it should be signified by a bearing which can be inserted with `:bearing:`

Here is an example definition:

‚ùó A **tick** is defined as the computation of and update to the next logic state. This means a tick is a transition, not a state. Here are some examples
  - "During the next tick, the logic gate will turn on"
  - "After the next tick the logic gate will be on"
